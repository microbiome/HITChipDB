## Extracting HITChip data from the MySQL database ('profiling')

Run the following commands in R (on a computer or virtual machine that
has access to the database). 

You can request the username, password, database name and port from
the [admins](contact). You also need SSH port forwarding, ask for more
instructions.

The program will guide you through preprocessing by asking to specify
the projects, samples, and preprocessing parameters. For further
instructions, contact the [admins](contact).


```{r prof, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# First update the HITChipDB package 
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "HITChipDB", username = "microbiome")

# Load the package
library(HITChipDB)

# Run profiling script over FTP
# NOTE: need to ssh port forwarding for localhost first - detailed instructions from the admins!
# NOTE: request the correct dbpwd and port from the admins (see above)
params <- run.profiling.script(dbuser = "root", dbpwd = "array", dbname = "Phyloarray", host = '127.0.0.1', port = ask.correct.port.number.from.admins) 
```

This prompts you through profiling options described in [full instructions](protocol).
